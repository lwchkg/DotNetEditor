# Dot Net Editor

Dot Net Editor is an VB/C# text editor with the ability to run code and code snippets. It can run a complete code file, or a snippet containing only the inside of a class or the inside of `Main()`.

The program does not use an interactive console when Console.ReadLine is executed. Instead the text in ìInput Dataêî is used as the input.
