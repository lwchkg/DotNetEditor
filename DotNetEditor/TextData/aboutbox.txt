{app} is an VB/C# text editor with the ability to run code and code snippets. It can run a complete code file, or a snippet containing only the inside of a class or the inside of Main().

The program does not use an interactive console when Console.ReadLine is executed. Instead the text in "Input Data" is used as the input.
